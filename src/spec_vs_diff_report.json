The Sales History UI uses useListSales() and shows loading/empty states, but the diff is truncated so item-by-item expandable details cannot be confirmed. Localization appears incomplete/mismatched: the new page references ptBR keys that are not shown as added in ptBR.ts.",

      "requirement": "Each sale is expandable to show item-by-item details (product name, quantity, unit price/subtotal).",
      "reason": "SalesHistoryPage.tsx is truncated before the expanded content; the diff excerpt does not show any rendering of sale line items (name/qty/unit price/subtotal) inside the collapsible content.",

      "reason": "SalesHistoryPage.tsx references localization keys that are not present in the shown ptBR.ts excerpt (e.g., ptBR.salesHistoryDesc vs the file shows salesHistoryDescription; also ptBR.loadingSales, ptBR.noSalesFound, ptBR.sale are referenced but not evidenced as added). This suggests missing/incorrect ptBR entries and/or inconsistent key usage.",
