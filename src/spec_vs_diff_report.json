  "summary": "Diff introduces a new pt-BR string map (frontend/src/i18n/ptBR.ts) and updates many UI components/pages (App shell, Dashboard, Inventory, Customers, POS cart/checkout, Cash Register) to use Portuguese display strings. Payment method labels are mapped to pt-BR via helper functions while keeping internal values like 'Cash'/'Credit' unchanged. Some required UI areas may still contain English because several modified files were omitted/truncated in the diff summary, and key POS/Cash Register flows beyond the shown components are not evidenced as fully translated.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Convert all user-facing UI text across the app from English to Portuguese (pt-BR), including page titles, headings, descriptions, buttons, placeholders, helper text, alerts, and empty states.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show translations applied across all screens/components in the app. Several modified files are omitted and multiple files are truncated; key POS and other areas (e.g., overall POS page wrapper, sale completion screen, any remaining navigation/header/footer text beyond what is shown) cannot be verified as fully localized from the provided evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Translate all dynamic and validation/error messages to Portuguese (pt-BR), including confirm() prompts and inline form/payment validation errors.",
      "reason": "Some required dynamic messages are translated (inventory/customer delete confirms; POS payment errors; cash-register not-open warning), but the diff summary is incomplete (omitted/truncated files). Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that *all* dynamic/validation/error messages throughout the app are translated.",
